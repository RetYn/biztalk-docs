# AS/400 Security
The support for AS/400 security is the same as for other Windows-initiated operations against the mainframe, with the following adjustments:  
  
-   No support for RACF, AFC/2, Kerberos, or Top Secret.  
  
-   Integrate with AS/400 native security system only.  
  
-   Support Single Sign-On via SSO.
