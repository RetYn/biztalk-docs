# Create Data Integration solutions

## Overview
Enterprise IT organizations need to deliver new solutions that extend investments in existing IBM systems and data stores. Host Integration Server offers data client technologies and a data service. These features enable IT professionals, enterprise developers, and knowledge workers to connect and integrate IBM DB2 and Informix relational database management systems and record-oriented host file systems with new solutions based on Microsoft Windows.
