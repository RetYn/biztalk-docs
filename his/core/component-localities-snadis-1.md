# Component Localities (SNADIS)
SNALinks can enter dynamically into a Host Integration Server system. The SNALink, in conjunction with the Base, acts as a whole locality and communicates with the other localities in the system using a Dynamic Access Module (DMOD).  
  
 [SNALink Interface](../core/snalink-interface1.md) describes the interface to the Base and the DMOD that allows a SNALink (or any other Host Integration Server component) to participate in a Host Integration Server system.
