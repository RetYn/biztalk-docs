# Protect Mainframe Security Credentials from Being Overridden
To prevent an attacker from gaining control over security credentials used to access a mainframe host, you should do the following:  
  
-   Use host-initiated Single Sign-On (SSO) in conjunction with valid host UID and PWD passed in the initial connection flows.  
  
-   Set the ClientContext to not allow security credentials to be overridden when using the `SelectionHint` property.
